## About Sofia AI

**Sofia AI** is a multi-agent orchestration platform built for businesses that want to automate complex workflows using AI agents — without writing code.

**GitHub**: https://github.com/JeanZorzetti/sofia-ia
**Documentation**: https://sofiaia.roilabs.com.br/docs

## What Sofia AI Does

Sofia AI allows users to:

1. **Create AI agents** — Define intelligent agents with custom system prompts, models (GPT-4, Claude, Llama), tools, and memory
2. **Build orchestrations** — Connect multiple agents in pipelines where each agent's output feeds the next
3. **Add knowledge bases (RAG)** — Upload PDFs, DOCX, CSV files and give agents access to this context via semantic search
4. **Integrate with external tools** — Google Sheets, Notion, HubSpot, Salesforce, Totvs, Zapier, Make, n8n
5. **Schedule executions** — Run orchestrations automatically via cron jobs (daily, weekly, monthly)
6. **Use agent memory** — Agents remember facts about users across conversations
7. **Deploy via API** — Public REST API with SDK support for JavaScript/TypeScript

## Core Concepts

- **Agent**: An AI entity with a system prompt, model selection, tools, and optional memory
- **Orchestration**: A pipeline of agents where output flows from agent to agent in sequence
- **Knowledge Base**: A collection of documents vectorized for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- **Plugin**: Custom JavaScript functions that extend agent capabilities
- **Agent-to-Agent**: Protocol for agents to delegate subtasks to other specialized agents

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What is Sofia AI?**
Sofia AI is a Brazilian SaaS platform for building and running multi-agent AI orchestrations — think CrewAI or AutoGen but with a no-code UI and built for production workflows.

**How is Sofia AI different from n8n or Zapier?**
Sofia AI is AI-native: every node is an LLM agent with reasoning capability, memory, and tools. n8n and Zapier connect APIs; Sofia AI connects thinking machines.

**Does Sofia AI require coding?**
No. You can build complete orchestrations via UI. For advanced users, there's a JavaScript plugin system and a REST API.

**What AI models does Sofia AI support?**
Sofia AI supports multiple providers: OpenAI (GPT-4o, GPT-4), Anthropic (Claude), Groq (Llama, Mixtral), and OpenRouter for hundreds of models.

**Is there a free plan?**
Yes. The Free plan includes 3 agents, 100 messages/month, and 1 knowledge base.

**Can I self-host Sofia AI?**
Yes. The codebase is open-source (MIT). See the GitHub repository for Docker Compose setup.
