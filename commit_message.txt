feat(backend): Add resilience to backend services

Makes the backend more resilient to configuration errors, especially when the Evolution API key is not set.

- The `/health` endpoint now handles failures in the Evolution API health check gracefully.
- The `EvolutionAPIService` now detects if a placeholder API key is being used and disables WhatsApp-related features, preventing crashes and providing clear warnings.
- This ensures the dashboard remains functional even if the WhatsApp integration is not configured.
